    - **Scope:** V1 would allow users to effectively navigate to their desired location. V2 would allow attractions to pop up on the map around the user's location. V3 would have reviews of the attractions, along with a location to get there. V4 would integrate the attractions to the users trip and create a navigation from start to finish with the new stops added.
